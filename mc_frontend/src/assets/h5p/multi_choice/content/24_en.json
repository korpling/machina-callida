It is something very special to have had such unrestricted violence for three years in the province of Asia that no statue, no picture, no vase [...] nor an offer of money has brought you away from your absolute incorruptibility and self-control, although your province offers all these things in abundance. But what can prove to be greater and more desirable than your efficiency, your serenity and your modesty [...] being spread out in the public of the province of Asia, before the eyes of the highly famous province and before the ears of all tribes and peoples? Or that people are not frightened by your journeys through the province, not sucked away by the cost of your reception, not disturbed by your coming? Or that wherever you go, both in public and in private homes, the highest joy breaks out because it turns out that the city has taken in a guardian and not a tyrant, the private home a hospitality and not a robber? In this regard, practice has certainly taught you that it is by no means enough to possess all these excellent qualities yourself, but that it is necessary to take care that in the provincial administration not only you alone, but all your subordinates seem to be responsible to the allies, the citizens and the state.<\/p>\n",
